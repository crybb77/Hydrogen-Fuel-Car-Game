# Hydrogen-Fuel-Car-Game
Our team created a Python-based game to support Global Edmonton's 1000 Hydrogen Vehicle Challenge. The game educates players on hydrogen fuel technology and its environmental benefits by simulating the operation of hydrogen-powered vehicles. It aims to raise awareness and inspire adoption of sustainable, clean transportation.
